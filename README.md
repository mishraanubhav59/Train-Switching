This repo describes the project called Train Switching , which enables the user to switch their train in real time to another train coming earlier than the train for which he has bought the ticket . 



# Problem : 

:point_right: This project solves the problem of long __*waiting*__ of people for the **delayed train** (In our project we have taken the case of Indian Railways but this product can be implemented for any transportation.). 
   
:point_right: Passengers hate waiting for delayed train due to any reason. We are trying to reduce this hate by providing an extra facility called "Train Switching" . 
   
:point_right: This solution will reduce the amount of people in waiting to a certain number and also can change the view of a person on railways.
       
# Our Solution :

:point_right: We are trying to build a application that passengers will use and they will going to check their train status.

:point_right: If their train in " On Time " then it's okay for them. No need to worry.

:point_right: But if the train is late (we have taken consideration for those trains who are at least late by more than an **hour** as a *threshold value*), the application will show that your train is late. 

:point_right: The app will suggest them the others train which is having the destination as that the user wants to go.

:point_right: This will save the user time of waiting for a certain train. 

:point_right: The user will *pay extra amount* if the price of the ticket is *higher* for the earlier train than the train that person booked and the booking will get confirmed and the person will receive a seat no. in new train.
        
        
        
# Benefits : 

:point_right: This will reduce the number of people in waiting for a their delayed train.

:point_right: A psychological rest will be there in case of dely of train.

:point_right: Indian Railway will get more passengers as their vacant seats are get occupied.

:point_right: It will also reduce the corruption in some extent as TC can't sell the tickets to people for their own profit.
